## üèó Architecture

The app uses a modular, scalable architecture based on **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**. The main modules are:

- **Domain**: Business logic, use cases, and models.
- **Data**: Data sources (remote/local), repositories, networking, and entity mapping.
- **Presentation**: SwiftUI views, view models, and navigation.
- **DesignSystem**: UI components, colors, fonts, and assets.
- **TestExtensions**: Utilities for testing and snapshotting.

Each module is implemented as a Swift Package for separation of concerns and reusability.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run via Xcode's test navigator or `Cmd+U`.
- **Snapshot Tests**: Ensure UI consistency. Use iPhone 16 Pro simulator with iOS 18.2, Dark Appearance disabled, and English language.
- **Mocking**: Protocol mocks are generated using Sourcery.
- **UI Automation**: See Maestro section below.
